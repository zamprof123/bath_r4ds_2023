## Joining tables

-   The information we need for a given analysis may not be just in one table.

-   For example, when forecasting elections we used the function `left_join` to combine the information from two tables.

-   Here we use a simpler example to illustrate the general challenge of combining tables.

-   Suppose we want to explore the relationship between population size for US states and electoral votes.

## Joining tables

-   We have the population size in this table:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


## Joining tables

library(tidyverse) 
library(dslabs) 
data(murders) 
head(murders) 
```

## Joining tables

-   and electoral votes in this one:

```{r}
data(polls_us_election_2016) 
head(results_us_election_2016) 
```

## Joining tables

-   Just concatenating these two tables together will not work since the order of the states is not the same.

```{r}
identical(results_us_election_2016$state, murders$state) 
```

-   The *join* functions, described below, are designed to handle this challenge.

## Joins

-   The *join* functions in the **dplyr** package make sure that the tables are combined so that matching rows are together.

-   If you know SQL, you will see that the approach and syntax is very similar.

-   The general idea is that one needs to identify one or more columns that will serve to match the two tables.

-   Then a new table with the combined information is returned.

## Joins

-   Notice what happens if we join the two tables above by state using `left_join` (we will remove the `others` column and rename `electoral_votes` so that the tables fit on the page):

```{r}


## Joins

tab <- left_join(murders, results_us_election_2016, by = "state") |> 
  select(-others) |> rename(ev = electoral_votes) 
head(tab) 
```

## Joins

-   The data has been successfully joined and we can now, for example, make a plot to explore the relationship:

```{r ev-vs-population, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggrepel) 
tab |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, ev, label = abb)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel() +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) 
```

## Joins

```{r ev-vs-population-code, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggrepel) 
tab |> ggplot(aes(population/10^6, ev, label = abb)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_text_repel() +  
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) 
```

## Joins

-   We see the relationship is close to linear with about 2 electoral votes for every million persons, but with very small states getting higher ratios.

-   In practice, it is not always the case that each row in one table has a matching row in the other.

-   For this reason, we have several versions of join.

-   To illustrate this challenge, we will take subsets of the tables above.


## Joins

-   We create the tables `tab1` and `tab2` so that they have some states in common but not all:

```{r}
tab_1 <- slice(murders, 1:6) |> select(state, population) 
tab_1 
```

## Joins

```{r}
tab_2 <- results_us_election_2016 |>  
  filter(state%in%c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona",  
                    "California", "Connecticut", "Delaware")) |>  
  select(state, electoral_votes) |> rename(ev = electoral_votes) 
tab_2 
```

-   We will use these two tables as examples in the next sections.

## Left join

-   Suppose we want a table like `tab_1`, but adding electoral votes to whatever states we have available.

-   For this, we use `left_join` with `tab_1` as the first argument and specify which column to match with`by` 

```{r}
left_join(tab_1, tab_2, by = "state") 
```

-   Note that `NA`s are added to the two states not appearing in `tab_2`.

## Left join

-   Also, notice that this function, as well as all the other joins, can receive the first arguments through the pipe:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tab_1 |> left_join(tab_2, by = "state") 
```

## Right join

-   If instead of a table with the same rows as first table, we want one with the same rows as second table, we can use `right_join`:

```{r}
tab_1 |> right_join(tab_2, by = "state") 
```

-   Now the NAs are in the column coming from `tab_1`.

## Inner join

-   If we want to keep only the rows that have information in both tables, we use `inner_join`.

-   You can think of this as an intersection:

```{r}
inner_join(tab_1, tab_2, by = "state") 
```

## Full join

-   If we want to keep all the rows and fill the missing parts with NAs, we can use `full_join`.

-   You can think of this as a union:

```{r}
full_join(tab_1, tab_2, by = "state") 
```

## Semi join

-   The `semi_join` function lets us keep the part of first table for which we have information in the second.

-   It does not add the columns of the second:

```{r}
semi_join(tab_1, tab_2, by = "state") 
```

## Anti join

-   The function `anti_join` is the opposite of `semi_join`.

-   It keeps the elements of the first table for which there is no information in the second:

```{r}
anti_join(tab_1, tab_2, by = "state") 
```

## Anti join

-   The following diagram summarizes the above joins:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"joins.png")) 
```

## Binding

-   Although we have yet to use it in this book, another common way in which datasets are combined is by *binding* them.

-   Unlike the join function, the binding functions do not try to match by a variable, but instead simply combine datasets.

-   If the datasets don't match by the appropriate dimensions, one obtains an error.

## Binding columns

-   The **dplyr** function *bind_cols* binds two objects by making them columns in a tibble.

-   For example, we quickly want to make a data frame consisting of numbers we can use.

```{r}
bind_cols(a = 1:3, b = 4:6) 
```

## Binding columns

-   This function requires that we assign names to the columns.

-   Here we chose `a` and `b`.

-   Note that there is an R-base function `cbind` with the exact same functionality.

-   An important difference is that `cbind` can create different types of objects, while `bind_cols` always produces a data frame.

## Binding columns

-   `bind_cols` can also bind two different data frames.

-   For example, here we break up the `tab` data frame and then bind them back together:

```{r}
tab_1 <- tab[, 1:3] 
tab_2 <- tab[, 4:6] 
tab_3 <- tab[, 7:8] 
new_tab <- bind_cols(tab_1, tab_2, tab_3) 
head(new_tab) 
```

## Binding by rows

-   The `bind_rows` function is similar to `bind_cols`, but binds rows instead of columns:

```{r}
tab_1 <- tab[1:2,] 
tab_2 <- tab[3:4,] 
bind_rows(tab_1, tab_2) 
```

-   This is based on an R-base function `rbind`.

## Set operators

-   Another set of commands useful for combining datasets are the set operators.

-   When applied to vectors, these behave as their names suggest.

-   Examples are `intersect`, `union`, `setdiff`, and `setequal`.

-   However, if the **tidyverse**, or more specifically **dplyr**, is loaded, these functions can be used on data frames as opposed to just on vectors.

## Intersect

-   You can take intersections of vectors of any type, such as numeric:

```{r}
intersect(1:10, 6:15) 
```

-   or characters:

```{r}
intersect(c("a","b","c"), c("b","c","d")) 
```

-   The **dplyr** package includes an `intersect` function that can be applied to tables with the same column names.

-   This function returns the rows in common between two tables.

## Intersect

-   To make sure we use the **dplyr** version of `intersect` rather than the base package version, we can use `dplyr::intersect` like this:

```{r}
tab_1 <- tab[1:5,] 
tab_2 <- tab[3:7,] 
dplyr::intersect(tab_1, tab_2) 
```

## Union

-   Similarly *union* takes the union of vectors.

-   For example:

```{r}
union(1:10, 6:15) 
union(c("a","b","c"), c("b","c","d")) 
```

## Union

-   The **dplyr** package includes a version of `union` that combines all the rows of two tables with the same column names.

```{r}
tab_1 <- tab[1:5,] 
tab_2 <- tab[3:7,] 
dplyr::union(tab_1, tab_2)  
```

## `setdiff`

-   The set difference between a first and second argument can be obtained with `setdiff`.

-   Unlike `intersect` and `union`, this function is not symmetric:

```{r}
setdiff(1:10, 6:15) 
setdiff(6:15, 1:10) 
```

## `setdiff`

-   As with the functions shown above, **dplyr** has a version for data frames:

```{r}
tab_1 <- tab[1:5,] 
tab_2 <- tab[3:7,] 
dplyr::setdiff(tab_1, tab_2) 
```

## `setequal`

-   Finally, the function `setequal` tells us if two sets are the same, regardless of order.

-   So notice that:

```{r}
setequal(1:5, 1:6) 
```


-   but:

```{r}
setequal(1:5, 5:1) 
```

## `setequal`

-   When applied to data frames that are not equal, regardless of order, the **dplyr** version provides a useful message letting us know how the sets are different:

```{r}
dplyr::setequal(tab_1, tab_2) 
```
