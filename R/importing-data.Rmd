# Importing data {#importing-data}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
img_path <- "R/img"
```
 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"csv-file.png"))
```


## Paths and the working directory 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filename <- "murders.csv"
dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs") 
fullpath <- file.path(dir, filename)
file.copy(fullpath, "murders.csv")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
dat <- read_csv(filename)
```

### The filesystem


### Relative and full paths

```{r, eval = FALSE}
system.file(package = "dslabs")
```

```{r}
dir <- system.file(package = "dslabs")
list.files(path = dir)
```

### The working directory

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wd <- getwd()
```

### Generating path names


```{r}
filename <- "murders.csv"
dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs") 
fullpath <- file.path(dir, filename)
```

```{r}
dir <- system.file(package = "dslabs") 
filename %in% list.files(file.path(dir, "extdata")) 
```

```{r}
dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs") 
```

```{r}
fullpath <- file.path(dir, filename)
```


### Copying files using paths


```{r}
file.copy(fullpath, "murders.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
list.files()
```

## The readr and readxl packages

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filename <- "murders.csv"
dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs") 
fullpath <- file.path(dir, filename)
file.copy(fullpath, "murders.csv")
```


### readr

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
```


The following functions are available to read-in spreadsheets:

| Function  | Format                                           | Typical suffix |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------| 
| read_table| white space separated values | txt |
| read_csv | comma separated values |  csv |
| read_csv2 | semicolon separated values | csv |
| read_tsv | tab delimited separated values | tsv |
| read_delim | general text file format, must define delimiter | txt |



```{r}
read_lines("murders.csv", n_max = 3)
```

```{r, message}
dat <- read_csv(filename)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(dat)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dat <- read_csv(fullpath)
```

### readxl


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)
```

The package provides functions to read-in Microsoft Excel formats:

| Function  | Format                                           | Typical suffix |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------| 
| read_excel | auto detect the format | xls, xlsx|
| read_xls | original format |  xls |
| read_xlsx | new format | xlsx |


## Exercises 


1\. Use the `read_csv` function to read each of the files that the following code saves in the `files` object: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
files <- list.files(path)
files
```

  
2\. Note that the last one, the `olive` file, gives us a warning. This is because the first line of the file is missing the header for the first column. 

Read the help file for `read_csv` to figure out how to read in the file without reading this header. If you skip the header, you should not get this warning. Save the result to an object called `dat`.

  
3\. A problem with the previous approach is that we don't know what the columns represent. Type:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
names(dat)
```

to see that the names are not informative.

Use the `readLines` function to read in just the first line (we later learn how to extract values from the output). 


## Downloading files

```{r, echo=FALSE}
url <- 
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/extdata/murders.csv"
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafalab/dslabs/master/inst/
extdata/murders.csv"
```


```{r, message = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv(url)
```


```{r}
download.file(url, "murders.csv")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tmp_filename <- tempfile()
download.file(url, tmp_filename)
dat <- read_csv(tmp_filename)
file.remove(tmp_filename)
```

## R-base importing functions

```{r}
dat2 <- read.csv(filename)
```


```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata", package = "dslabs")
filename <- "murders.csv"
x <- scan(file.path(path, filename), sep = ",", what = "c")
x[1:10]
```


## Text versus binary files

## Unicode versus ASCII

## Organizing data with spreadsheets


* __Be Consistent__ - Before you commence entering data, have a plan. Once you have a plan, be consistent and stick to it. 
* __Choose Good Names for Things__ - You want the names you pick for objects, files, and directories to be memorable, easy to spell, and descriptive. This is actually a hard balance to achieve and it does require time and thought. One important rule to follow is **do not use spaces**, use underscores `_` or dashes instead `-`. Also, avoid symbols; stick to letters and numbers.
* __Write Dates as YYYY-MM-DD__ -  To avoid confusion, we strongly recommend using this global ISO 8601 standard.
* __No Empty Cells__ - Fill in all cells and use some common code for missing data. 
* __Put Just One Thing in a Cell__ - It is better to add columns to store the extra information rather than having more than one piece of information in one cell.
* __Make It a Rectangle__ - The spreadsheet should be a rectangle. 
* __Create a Data Dictionary__ - If you need to explain things, such as what the columns are or what the labels used for categorical variables are, do this in a separate file.
* __No Calculations in the Raw Data Files__ - Excel permits you to perform calculations. Do not make this part of your spreadsheet. Code for calculations should be in a script.
* __Do Not Use Font Color or Highlighting as Data__ - Most import functions are not able to import this information. Encode this information as a variable instead.
* __Make Backups__ - Make regular backups of your data. 
* __Use Data Validation to Avoid Errors__ - Leverage the tools in your spreadsheet software so that the process is as error-free and repetitive-stress-injury-free as possible. 
* __Save the Data as Text Files__ - Save files for sharing in comma or tab delimited format.
    
## Exercises 

1\. Pick a measurement you can take on a regular basis. For example, your daily weight or how long it takes you to run 5 miles. Keep a spreadsheet that includes the date, the hour, the measurement, and any other informative variable you think is worth keeping. Do this for 2 weeks. Then make a plot.


```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
tmp <- file.remove("murders.csv")
```
